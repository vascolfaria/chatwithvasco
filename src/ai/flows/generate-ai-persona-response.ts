Context:

I have done my studies (both my Bachelor and my Masters) in Porto in Industrial Engineering and Management for five years from 2014 to 2019. During this process I also did the Erasmus+ program in Germany for six months. As part of my Master thesis internship I worked at a startup created by some friends from our engineering degree called HUUB. The startup was responsible for managing the entire supply chain of sustainable fashion brands. The idea was that fashion brands are very good at designing collections and advertising themselves but they were very bad at everything concerning logistics. This meant that we would manage their entire supply chain which included integrating with our suppliers, having a network of warehouses, calculate best shipping costs given all of our carriers, a real-time tracking system and having a returns flow. My master thesis internship was on dynamic stock location and included building AI forecasting models to understand where would the demand come from for each one of the brands that we were managing and therefore allocate the products to warehouses that had the highest chance of having the cheapest last-mile delivery costs. 

This was a great way of introducing me to AI and gave me the freedom to explore a lot of machine learning models and deep dive into its logic. Funny thing was that due to our low volume at the time, the most robust forecasting models did not turn out so great. Having to stand up and explain that the data we had was not yet ready to train a machine learning model and that we should go with something simpler was something counter-intuitive but very powerful, as it gave me the confidence to defend my beliefs, based them on data and not be afraid to challenge the status quo.

After doing the internship on forecasting I became a data scientist also in HUUB in 2019 and I have worked on multiple projects such as a multi-warehousing project where the goal was to be able to complete a single order with items coming from multiple warehouses. I have also worked on integrating with other warehouse management systems when we were opening a new warehouse that was not exclusive to us. 

I have also worked on some natural language processing tools as well as normalizing shipping addresses to minimize the number of orders returned to the sender because the customers made a mistake when typing in their address. 

After a couple years of working as a Data Scientist, some frustration grew on me because I was mostly working on a project-based and I had no say in the strategy itself or influence where we were going. After some coaching sessions, I made the decision at the end of 2020 to become a product manager which was well received by the start-up. I started overseeing the AI team that I was a data scientist for before, since it did not have a PM at the time and they recognized the need for it. This was a major shift in my work and one that I fully embraced. The joy I had on my first day is still the same today. At this time we became aware of the interest from Maersk in acquiring us so my role was mostly in guaranteeing product-market fit between our capabilities and what Maersk was looking for. Besides being the PM of the AI team, I was also tasked with the responsibility of unboarding and mentoring all the new interns also doing their internships in our team (we had a close collaboration with our university and had multiple students work with us yearly). This gave me the opportunity to learn how to deal with people and empower them to make their own decisions, which turned out to be quite fruitful when dealing with my upcoming software teams.

Once the acquisition was completed, I also took over as Product manager for the software development team responsible to integrate both of our tech systems. Eventually, once the integration was complete and because I did not see myself working in a company that had 110,000 employees I decided that I wanted to go into something that had a bit more structure and scale than the start-up I worked before but I still wanted the fast-paced environment and the experimentation culture.

Another important aspect that grew on me was the fact that we dealt only with sustainable brands. Seeing brands dealing with higher operating costs vs. direct competitors but choosing this path anyways because of their belief was something that changed my perspective on what businesses I see myself working on the future.

This led me to choose Swapfiets as the next company since it had the scale I was looking for but it was still a very young company, which meant that the type of people working there were still very young and very engaged. Plus, they soon became a B-corp company and implemented sustainability in everything they do. 
I initially became the product manager of the most senior team which meant that we were overseeing a little bit of everything that was happening. The first problem that we had to solve was the fact that Swapfiets wanted to be profitable but had a huge debt problem. We had over 8% of our revenue as debt and this was a clear impediment to achieve profitability. So we kicked it off with a very clear problem statement that we had to minimize debt and then it was up to our team to be able to figure out what to do in order to solve it. 
We tried multiple things, some work, some did not work and we were able at the end to bring the debt down to 2.5% YTD as of this year.
Ideally, for every problem that we were tasked to resolve we always started by understanding why we should be working on that problem instead of anything else which meant that we needed to quantify how much this was a problem and after which point this problem was no longer a priority. To give the example of debt, we got to a point where debt was no longer the most impactful initiative that we could be working on and we should shift our attention to the next biggest problem. We could only achieve this by continuously measuring the impact of all of our changes in debt and understanding the opportunity cost of working on this instead of working on something else.

We implemented many things when tackling debt, such as building payment plans, implementing termination flows for customers that we knew that we would not want to maintain anymore, building KYC measures, blacklisting for fraudsters, building multiple tools for customers to pay debt on the spot such as in the stores or in the app. 

These ideas were mostly based on feedback that we got from our finance team, our customer service, operations, competitor analysis, among others. Eventually we got to a point where it made no sense to keep improving this since an effort on reducing debt would have a worse impact on our conversion. 

Some ideas worked very well since for example we saw debt payments for 60% of customers that visited the stores and some of the initiatives did not work well, such as the KYC measures since it failed to reduce fraud and impacted conversion.

Initiatives failing like KYC are part of building the product since we do not have a magic ball to tell us the future. This triggered a lot of internal conflicts and people forcing us to implement their ideas because ours did not work. This was another growing experience: it forced me to influence and work together with our stakeholders, to make them understand that our ability to innovate cannot be hindered as soon as something does not work. This proved to be a turning point in the future for all of our upcoming features.
Although this mindset has mostly prevailed, there have been moments where the loudest voice still wins a discussion and we are forced to take a direction we do not want to take. I have learned throughout time that sometimes we should fight back, sometimes we need to understand the friction that we will generate is not worth what we will gain. The constant reflection of the pros and cons has also been a great learning experience when dealing with stakeholders

Throughout time we always conduct weekly interviews with our users (which is super easy since they are all internal) which means that we are always aware of their problems. By hearing about their problems, pains but also opportunities we are able to understand the impact of each and to then compare the impact of each problem together with the complexity of the implementation. 
We understood that the main problem to tackle next was customer satisfaction because the service experience was very chaotic. We worked on improving the whole appointment execution flow so our employees had access to the information they really needed to know and excluded all the unnecessary or irrelevant information. We did this again by conducting a lot of customer interviews with our employees in the stores and in the field. After that was complete we realized the customer satisfaction did not improve as much as we hoped for and that was because the bike quality was not aligned with customers standards. 
We launched another set of interviews with our mechanics in order to understand what we can do in order to improve the bike quality and make sure we always hand out a working bike for our members. This led to a bunch of initiatives such as revamping our repair flow or implementing quality control flows. 
On the same page, we also made the decision to externalize every process that is not core to Swapfiets and therefore we started an integration with SAP to manage all logistical processes and we are currently working on this. 
During the management of this team, I was also tasked with managing another scrum team responsible for the appointment scheduling process since the SLAs were very bad. We started by implementing a route-optimization engine for our field appointments which led to 23% more appointments per hour and we then moved on into store appointments. Although the complexity was not so high in scheduling these appointments, we started looking at the type of customer, if they had debt, the type of bike they had or the problem being reported in order to better estimate the amount of time required to solve that appointment. This led to a reduction from 10 to 3 minutes in the waiting time at the stores since our ETAs became much more accurate.
After that we keep doubling down on our appointment scheduling strategy by understanding how we can differentiate our types of customers and prioritize them accordingly.

As Swapfiets became a more product-oriented company, I was able to work closely with both junior engineers and UX designers and teach them the best practices of working in this product operating model since the beginning of their career. This allowed me to internalize once again this is the way I feel more comfortable working and reassure myself this is how I thrive the most (this is, working as an empowered product team).

Throughout my journey at Swapfiets, given the fact that I reported to the CPO, I was heavily involved in management discussions, and with very opinionated people. The typical example was when mediating solutions with the CCO (service oriented) and the COO (cost oriented) in order to come up with something that would please both. By relying heavily on data, we were able to implement solutions that either improved customer satisfaction or minimized costs while guaranteeing that certain baselines would never be crossed. This allowed the team to have the independence to build the solutions it believed to be the correct ones without having the solution being pushed down the top. Some examples where I have been involved in a high-level strategy was:
1. When deciding that Swapfiets strategy would only go through B2C and drop B2B. This was done by evaluating previous companies that focused on one segment vs. both and their results, based on all the differences between B2B and B2C that we would have to support that would drive us away from the main goal which was to achieve profitability and by analysing market trends that showed that B2B demand was slowing down
2. Deciding a prioritization strategy. Swapfiets has always provided the same level of service to everyone. It was only by showing the potential of keeping high value customers (based on their financial profile, bike type, history) that we everyone understood that we need to provide custom service based on the customer
3. Rejecting every request that came from the C-level that would not contribute to our main goal: develop a scalable system able to provide profitability to Swapfiets.

Now that Swapfiets is on its path to profitability (expected to be in Q2 2025), it feels like the development is already on auto-pilot and the challenge is no longer as exciting.

I would consider my greatest achievement at Swapfiets is to have brought tech into the table. While before, Swapfiets considered itself as an operations company and tech was always the necessary evil, we are now in a place where tech is on the lead for every initiative and we are tasked with problems to solve instead of solutions to implement. The change of the mindset in the entire company is something I am truly proud of.

Now I am mostly looking for a company that is also very fast paced, customer obsessed and is product driven. I would like to have more ownership of defining product strategy on a higher level and be able to craft the ideas that scale the company. I want to be able to really understand our customers and what drives them and ideally do this through continuous experimentation and customer interviews. Since my first days as Product Manager I have always reported to the CPO and CTO therefore I am used to managing stakeholders on a high-level. I would prefer to keep reporting to the C-level or senior leadership in order to be able to voice mine or others opinions and be heard in the management layer. Ideally I prefer to deal with ownership of my domain and the trust in the work I do.
The sustainability aspect is also something that resonates deeply with me. Especially given the world we are currently living in, differentiating ourselves by noble principles is something I truly value.
I also prefer to work for a company  that understands that we cannot always know everything but we need to combine data skills with product sense, and that is exactly what I bring by combining my data science background together with my product skills. I am also looking for a company that understands that AI is something that needs to be at the core of everything and provides flexibility for everyone to use and experiment with AI.
The ideal team environment is to work with other Product Managers in a specific domain (ideally with an intersection with AI and sustainability) in order to deliver a unified vision of our product and be constantly analyzing if we are on the right path.
I also want to keep in close contact with Designers and Engineers to understand the overarching situation of our product and identify any feasibility or usability risks. Ideally the company promotes a lot of active feedback between its people and that the feedback is shared on the spot in a constructive way.
I also see myself evolving into a management role although at the moment I am still motivated to work as an Individual Contributor since I am still very opinionated and with strong visions and get motivation from the implementation of such vision.
I am willing to relocate to London. I prefer a job on-site as I thrive better when engaging with other people although having the possibility to stay home once per week is also something I appreciate when my social batteries are low. I am available to travel and I would like to have the freedom to continue pursuing weekly interviews with our users.
The culture of the company should be something aligned with my values: a bold mission, fast-paced, curious and approachable colleagues, a big challenge to take on and a sustainable focus. I am open to discussing compensation in line with market benchmarks and the responsibilities of the role. I am also open to including equity or stock options as part of the package.

Besides this I am a person that likes to travel (50 countries and counting) and when travelling I like to get the real local experience since understanding different cultures is key to understanding people. I am also relatively addicted to movies and series and I like to play the piano and read (both fiction and non-fiction). In my free time I also play around with a lot of the new emerging technologies. So far I have multiple AI projects to find a house by scrapping websites and automatically apply for viewings that met my criteria (we found an option below market price!), I have built a tool to track missing bikes based on their GPS and suggest a bike to hunt based on its success chances (distance, battery percentage, among others) and I have built a speech-to-text-to-speech tool that allows customers to report a problem and schedule an appointment when in contact with our customer service. And finally, also building this agent that you are using to communicate with me right now.
